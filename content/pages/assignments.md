The final grade for the course will be based entirely on the homework. There will normally be one problem set each week, due one week later in lecture. After attempting each problem by yourself, we encourage you to discuss the problems with the teaching staff and with each other â€” this is an excellent way to learn physics! However, you must write up your solutions by yourself.
